Remember that God does not look at things the way the world does and your success is not required to be spiritually rich in the eyes of the Lord (Isa 55:8-9; 1 Sam 16:7; James 4:4).</p>

><sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> “That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life—whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> Look at the birds. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren’t you far more valuable to him than they are? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?
>
><sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> “And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. <span style="color:Goldenrod;">Why do you have so little faith?</span>
>
><sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> “So don’t worry about these things, saying, ‘What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?’ 32 <span style="color:Goldenrod;">These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers</span>, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. (New Living Translation, 2015, Matt. 6:25-32 NLT).

> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear not, therefore; <span style="font-weight:bold;">you are of more value than many sparrows</span> (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Matt. 10:29-31 ESV)

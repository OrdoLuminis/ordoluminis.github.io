Ordo Dei Invictus recognizes Apostles’ Creed (A.D. 650).

---

<br>

I believe in God the Father Almighty,<br>
maker of heaven and earth;<br>

And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<br>
which was conceived by the Holy Ghost,<br>
born of the Virgin Mary,<br>
suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
was crucified, dead, and buried:<br>
he descended into hell;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">†</sup><br>
the third day he arose again from the dead;<br>
he ascended into heaven,<br>
and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty,<br>
from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br>

I believe in the Holy Ghost;<br>
the holy catholick<sup style="font-weight:bold;">‡</sup> church;<br>
the communion of saints;<br>
the forgiveness of sins;<br>
the resurrection of the body;<br>
and the life everlasting.

Amen.

<sup style="font-weight:bold;">‡</sup> <sup>Catholic in this sense means *&ldquo;Universal&rdquo;*, and is referring to all believers throughout all ages. This is not speaking about the Roman Catholic church as an institution. It's also worth noting that [Ancient Catholic Orthodoxy](https://www.crossway.org/articles/10-things-you-should-know-about-reformed-theology-2/) is not Roman Catholicism.</sup>

This is undeniable proof using scripture alone, that a turning away from sin was what Jesus meant in Matt. 4:17 when he said *"Repent."* He wanted you to feel true contrition (2Cor. 7:10) for the things you have done, to the point of turning away from them.

> When God raised up his servant, Jesus, he sent him <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">first</span> to you people of Israel, to bless you by <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">turning each of you back from your sinful ways</span>. &mdash; Acts 3:26 NLT

What was Jesus' <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">first</span> fundamental summons? It was to preach Repentance as an inward resolve to turn from sin, found in Matt. 4:17 and reinforced by Ac 3:26 above.

> From that time Jesus <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">began</span> to preach this message: “<span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">Repent</span>, for the kingdom of heaven is near!” &mdash; Matthew 4:17 NET

2 Cor. 7:10 NLT tells us that true repentance is a contrition that leads to a turn from sin, while false repentance or attrition, leads to death.

> 7:9-10 Two kinds of sorrow are mentioned: (1) **Worldly sorrow** that **lacks repentance** leads to spiritual death (e.g., see Matt 27:3-6; Heb 12:16-17). <span style="color:Goldenrod;">(2) Sorrow that <span style="font-weight:bold;">leads us away from sin</span> leads to <span style="font-weight:bold;">salvation</span></span>, as it did when the church in Corinth responded positively to Paul's rebuke. &mdash; Filament Study Bible

**God has spoken.** The Apostles have written. The only question is, will you receive their correction? Do not listen to false teachers who tell you that repentance is only a mind change. They will lead you and your family into destruction. Instead [call no man your teacher](https://deiinvictus.com/posts/the-old-ways/), turn from your sin (*repent*), and place your trust (*faith*) in Christ alone.

> Therefore repent and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">turn back</span> so that your sins may be wiped out, &mdash; Acts 3:19 NET

>> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">3:19 Repent . . . and turn to God. <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">Repentance is turning away from sin.</span> Faith is turning to God for salvation. See 2:38 and note. times of refreshing. The blessings and glories of the Messianic age, synonymous with “the time . . . for God to restore everything” (v. 21). Though the kingdom of God has been inaugurated through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, it is yet to be consummated in the future. &mdash; The NIV <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Purple;">Biblical Theology Study Bible,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">165 scholars</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Purple;">(100+ NIV; 65 Study); Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, Yale, California, London, Belfast, Claremont, Denver, Westminister, & Dallas.</span></span>

The message that <span style="font-style:italic;">&ldquo;There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.&rdquo;</span> should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

<!-- It's most fascinating that Jesus describes [New Testament repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Mt 11:21-22) <a href="#GPT-4-Turbo">in the same way</a> the Old Testament does (Job 42:6).  -->

> Then he said, “I tell you the truth, unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven. &mdash; Matthew 18:3 NLT

The world's most authoritative Greek lexicons show that the true meaning of [metanoéō](/assets/images/greek/BDAG/metanoeo.png) falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted in a (religio-)ethical sense.*&rdquo; [metánoia](/assets/images/greek/BDAG/metanoia.png) also falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*repentance, turning about, conversion*&rdquo; as taught by Christ & The Apostles (Ac 3:19,26; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).

<!-- Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 3:19,26; 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5). It's the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that *&ldquo;produces&rdquo;* these changes, and rest assured, if your faith is genuine, they will come (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7).

ℹ️ Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8–10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

I think it is in your best interest to side with Christ, the Apostles, the scriptures, the authoritative Greek lexicons and dictionaries, the academic community of biblical language scholars, and centuries of sound doctrine, creeds, and confessions. -->

<!-- Justification is by faith apart from the works of the law (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**. -->

<!-- > The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (**Matt. 4:17**), the Twelve (Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts 17:30; 26:20), and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19). It was part of Jesus’ summary of the gospel that was to be taken to the world (Luke 24:47).

<!-- Just because justification is by fath alone doesn't mean we cast a blind eye on what regeneration looks like.

scripture has identified those who practice sin as not true born agains.

instead of arguing with God, lets try to understand it

you cant have a god inside of you and there not be a cause and effect
there will be changes in your lifestyle brought on by the holy spirit

why teachers who teach osas are destroying your children, and making you complicit in their destruction

obersvations of sanctification are never legalisitc  -->

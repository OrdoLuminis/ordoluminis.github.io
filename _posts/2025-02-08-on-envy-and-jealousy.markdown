If you pay close attention, your adversaries will reveal their deepest fears cloaked in their arrogance. When they puff out their chest and boast, it's not confidence&mdash;It's a façade of superiority borne from their own insecurities. This bravado is a defense mechanism, a desperate attempt to conceal their vulnerabilities. In truth, they are laying bare their weaknesses for all to see, and by comparing themselves to others, they reveal whom they envy. I've yet to encounter a truly secure individual who feels the need to act in such a manner; as intelligence grows, so too does humility. Those who speak ill of others are merely projecting their own insecurities and limitations onto those they envy.

## Those Who Malign Others Are Projecting Their Own Insecurities and Limitations Upon Those They Envy

<p style="text-indent:2em;">Because it is my responsibility to rebuke those inside the church who are practicing sin, this is my rebuke to the envious and divisive (1Tim. 5:20; 1Cor. 5:11-13; Jud. 1:19): If you pay close attention, your adversaries will reveal their deepest fears cloaked in their arrogance. When they puff out their chest and boast, it's not confidence&mdash;It's a façade of superiority borne from their own insecurities, and by comparing themselves to others, they reveal whom they envy. This bravado is a defense mechanism, a desperate attempt to conceal their vulnerabilities. In truth, they are laying bare their weaknesses for all to see. I've yet to encounter a truly secure individual who feels the need to act in such a manner; as intelligence grows, so too does humility. Those who speak ill of others are merely projecting their own insecurities and limitations onto those they envy. As Seneca (1889) vividly illustrates in his <em>Minor Dialogues, De Tranquillitate Animi</em> (On the Tranquility of the Mind):</p>

<blockquote>hence comes the State of Mind of those who loathe their idleness, complain that they have nothing to do, and view the progress of others with the bitterest jealousy: for an unhappy sloth favours the growth of envy, and those who cannot succeed themselves wish everyone else to be ruined (p. 257).</blockquote>

The Bible reveals that this group contains the practitioners of evil&mdash;encompassing the irreligious, unrepentant, and self-deceived who give strong evidence that they are <strong>not</strong> truly born‑again (1Jn. 3:9–10; Jn 3:3; Ac 3:26):

<blockquote>
For where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is disorder and every evil <strong>practice</strong>. (NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2015, James 3:16).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
He knew very well that the religious leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy (New Living Translation, 2015, Matt. 27:18).
</blockquote>

Instead, true Christians heed Paul's counsel in Philippians and learn from Peter’s exchange with Jesus in John; for what business is it of yours what Christ does in the lives of others unless it is to support them?

<blockquote>
Peter asked Jesus, “What about him, Lord?” Jesus replied, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? As for you, follow me” (New Living Translation, 2015, John 21:21–22).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Don’t be selfish; don’t try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves (New Living Translation, 2015, Philippians 2:3).

# I. On the Relation of Faith and Works

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
The Bible clearly states that we are saved by grace through faith apart from the works of the law.<sup>1</sup> The Bible also clearly warns that if we practice lifestyles of sin we will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<sup>2</sup> <strong>Protestants</strong> affirm both statements as true, applying regeneration<sup>3</sup>&mdash;and, at times, sanctification&mdash;instead of justification in their interpretation of the &ldquo;practice verses.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> In other words, the transformative process is seen as God's work in you, rather than an effort on your part to earn or merit salvation. The Holy Spirit produces the fruit, not human decision and efforts,<sup>5</sup> as a consequence of your new nature.<sup>6</sup> In essence, ‚Äúworks‚Äëfruit‚Äù not ‚Äúworks‚Äësalvation.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>Jesus replied, ‚ÄúI tell you the truth, unless you are born again [regenerated<sup>3</sup>], you cannot see the Kingdom of God‚Äù (New Living Translation, 2015, John 3:3).</blockquote>

In contrast, a <a href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/identifying-the-cults-and-heretical-sects/">legalist</a> applies the concept of justification to the &ldquo;practice verses,&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> and rejects justification by grace through faith apart from works.<sup>1</sup> Meanwhile, an <a href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/identifying-the-cults-and-heretical-sects/">antinomian</a> denies the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles altogether on the &ldquo;practice verses,&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> adhering instead to a distorted interpretation of faith alone (i.e. a faith that is dead, disingenuine, and fruitless)<sup>7</sup> which has no historical basis within <strong>Protestantism</strong>.<br>

## 1.1 Consensus Among Historic Creeds and Confessions of Protestantism

### 1.1.1 Reformed Baptist & Presbyterian

#### 1.1.1.1 John Calvin (1509-1564) was the first and most influential theologian in the Reformed tradition.

> Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time **sanctify**. ... Thus it is clear how true it is that **we are justified not without works yet not through works** (Calvin, 1960, 3.16.1).

> **It is therefore faith alone which justifies, and yet the faith which justifies is not alone** (Calvin, 2014, Canon 11).

#### 1.1.1.2 Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) is the doctrinal standard for Presbyterian and Reformed churches.

> 11.2: Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification: **yet is not alone in the person justified**, but is ever accompanied with all the other saving graces, and **is no dead faith**, but worketh by love (Schaff, 2022, 3.2.16 "Confessio Fidei Westmonasteriensis").

### 1.1.2 Lutheranism

#### 1.1.2.1 Formula of Concord (1576) the great summary and consensus of Lutheran doctrine.

> III. & VIII. We believe, also teach, and confess that Faith alone is the means and instrument whereby we lay hold on Christ the Saviour ... after that man is justified by faith, then that true and living faith works by love, and **good works always follow justifying faith**, and are most certainly found together with it, provided only it be true and living faith. For **true faith is never alone** (Schaff, 2022, 3.1 "FORMULA CONCORDI√Ü").

### 1.1.3 Anglican and Episcopalian

#### 1.1.3.1 Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England (1571) doctrinal standard for Anglican and Episcopalian churches.

> XII. Of Good Works: Albeit that **Good Works, which are fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification**... do spring out necessarily of a true and lively faith... by them a lively Faith may be as **evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit** (Schaff, 2022, 3.2.10 "ARTICULI XXXIX. ECCLESI√Ü ANGLICAN√Ü").

### 1.1.4 Baptist

#### 1.1.4.1 New Hampshire Baptist Confession (1833) Statement for Baptist churches.

> VII. & VIII. Regeneration ... is effected ... by the power of the Holy Spirit ... **its proper evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance, and faith, and newness of life**. ... We believe that Repentance and Faith are sacred duties, and also inseparable graces, wrought in our souls by the regenerating Spirit of God; whereby being deeply convinced of our guilt, danger, and helplessness, and of the way of salvation by Christ, we turn to God with unfeigned contrition, confession, and supplication for mercy (Schaff, 2022, 3.3.2.2 "THE NEW HAMPSHIRE BAPTIST CONFESSION").

### 1.1.5 Methodist

#### 1.1.5.1 John Wesley (1703-1791) the founder of Methodism.

> We are, doubtless, justified by faith. This is the corner-stone of the whole Christian building. ... **So that if good works do not follow our faith**, even all inward and outward holiness, **it is plain our faith is nothing worth; we are yet in our sins** (Wesley, 1872, see Discourses‚ÄØI‚ÄìII; Sermons‚ÄØ35‚Äì36).

### 1.1.6 Pentecostal

#### 1.1.6.1 Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths (1916) one of the oldest and largest Pentecostal denominations.

> **Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ**. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being justified by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God, according to the hope of eternal life (Assemblies of God USA, n.d., sec. 5 "Conditions to Salvation" section).

> **The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness**. (Eph. 4:24; Titus 2:12) (Assemblies of God USA, n.d., sec. 5 "The Evidences of Salvation" section).

## 1.2 Consensus Among Academics

### 1.2.1 Study Bible Scholarship

#### 1.2.1.1 ESV Study Bible Scholars

Turn to page 2433 in the ESV Study Bible (2008). The notes for 1 John 3:6-10 ESV read as follows:

> **3:6‚Äì7** No one who abides ‚Ä¶ keeps on sinning. True followers of Christ do not recklessly and habitually violate what their anointing (2:20, 27) has planted within them (see note on 3:9‚Äì10). **Those who do habitually sin have neither seen him nor known him. They are not genuine Christians**. On ‚Äúabides,‚Äù see also notes on John 8:31; 15:4.
>
> **3:8** The reason the Son of God appeared restates v. 5 but here specifies the connection of sin to the devil. Knowing Christ means becoming involved in an all-out war against the works of the devil, that is, the practice of sinning.
>
> **3:9-10** born of God. See John 3:3‚Äì8. God‚Äôs seed. Some take this to be the Word of God that brings about the new birth (cf. James 1:18, 22; 1 Pet. 1:23, 25). Others see it as a way of speaking of the Holy Spirit in his **regenerating and transforming presence within the believer**. Since the Holy Spirit works through the Word in regeneration, both of these ideas are likely intended here. In other words, because the Word is present in the believer‚Äôs heart through the work of the Spirit, **the believer cannot keep on sinning. Thus the hearts of genuine Christians** (those who are truly children of God) have been **so transformed that they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin**‚Äîthough this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8‚Äì10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *‚ÄúYou will recognize them by their fruits‚Äù* (Matt. 7:16). does not love his brother. John returns to the ethical dimension, the true barometer of what people really believe, whatever they may say (1Jn. 3:6-10 ESV).<sup>‚Ä†</sup>

#### 1.2.1.2 NIV Biblical Theology Study Bible Scholars

> 3:6 **No one who lives in him keeps on sinning.** The claim that one can remain in Christ while continuing to indulge in sinful behavior is **ridiculous, if not blasphemous**, for ‚Äúin him is no sin‚Äù (v. 5). See note on v. 9.
>
> 3:8 **the devil has been sinning from the beginning.** This is an allusion to Genesis 3, where the devil tempts the first couple to disobey God (cf. John 8:44). destroy the devil‚Äôs work. The devil seeks to turn people aside from doing God‚Äôs will, causing them to sin, so that he may accuse them before God and demand judgment upon them. By his death Jesus atoned for human sin, thus removing the basis of the devil‚Äôs accusation and so destroying his work.
>
> 3:9 **God‚Äôs seed.** A daring metaphor employing the word ‚Äúseed‚Äù (Greek sperma) to depict the Spirit‚Äôs work in believers. Unlike the children of the devil (in this case the secessionists), the children of God do not go on sinning because the Spirit dwells within them. There is an apparent contradiction in 1 John concerning sin in the believer‚Äôs life: those who claim not to have sinned are liars (1:10); those born of God do not and cannot sin (3:6, 9). A possible resolution is that, in context, 3:4 defines the latter sin as ‚Äúlawlessness‚Äù (Greek anomia). In the NT this word refers not to breaking the law but to rebelling against God (like the devil‚Äôs rebellion). If this is the case, John is saying that those who claim to know God and yet sin in this way certainly do not know God and are, in fact, in league with the devil. This is the sin that those born of God do not and cannot commit. It is possible for believers to sin in other ways, as 1:8‚Äî2:1 indicates (NIV Biblical Theology Study Bible, 2018, 1Jn. 3:6-10 NIV).<sup>‚Ä°</sup>

Jn 8.44).** **9‚Äì10:** God‚Äôs seed: the Holy Spirit (2.26‚Äì27) and mutual love (Jn 13.35) distinguish God‚Äôs children (The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, 2018, 1Jn. 3:4-10).<sup>¬∂</sup>

#### 1.2.1.6 The Jewish Annotated New Testament Scholars

> **6‚Äì10:** No one who abides in him sins, the author sets a very high standard of behavior (see vv. 8‚Äì10). The main forms of sin, however, seem to be the failure to love their brothers and sisters and denial of God and the Son (2.22). **8:** Child of the devil, perhaps a reference to those who withdrew (2.19); there is no indication here of the identification of Jews as children of the devil, as in Jn 8.44. **9:** Seed, perhaps the Holy Spirit; one‚Äôs ‚Äúseed‚Äù is one‚Äôs offspring, here the deeds of love and faith in God (The Jewish Annotated New Testament, 2011, 1Jn. 3:6-9).<sup>Œî</sup>

#### 1.2.1.7 NKJV Thomas Nelson Study Bible Scholars

Turn to page 2048 in the NKJV Thomas Nelson Study Bible (2014). The notes for 1 John 3:5-10 NKJV read as follows:

> 3:5, 6 if christ is sinless and the purpose of his coming was to remove sin, then **whoever abides in Him does not sin.** habitually sinful conduct indicates an absence of fellowship with christ. thus if we claim to be a christian but sin is our way of life, **our status as children of God can legitimately be questioned**.
>
> 3:7 **let no one deceive you:** evidently the antichrists who were denying the doctrine of christ (2:22) were also claiming to know God, yet were living in unrighteousness (1:6). **true believers practice righteousness because the one in whom they dwell is righteous.** God‚Äôs righteousness is revealed in his children through their conduct. righteous conduct does not produce righteous character, but reveals its presence in us.
>
> 3:8 Satan‚Äôs sinful nature is shown through the lives of those who belong to him. Jesus‚Äô purpose in coming was to destroy the devil‚Äôs works. a person who sins, even a believer, is of the devil in the sense that he is participating in the devil‚Äôs activity (2:19). thus John is indicating that it is possible for believers to do that which is of the devil (see mark 8:31‚Äì33; James 3:6).
>
> 3:9 the seed that remains is probably the divine nature in which believers can participate (see 2 pet. 1:4). But the seed has been variously interpreted as Jesus, the holy Spirit, Scripture, or the gospel message. in other words, this verse is saying that habitual sin is not con- sistent with the christian walk.
>
> 3:10 christians manifest their nature by practicing righteousness (2:7). Children of the devil display their basic nature by sinning. Believers who sin are not expressing their nature as children of God; instead, they are following the devil‚Äôs pattern (1Jn. 3:5-10 NKJV).<sup>‚óä</sup>

### 1.2.2 Scientist Theologians

### 1.2.3 Reformed Baptist & Presbyterian Theologians -->



<!-- Saving faith **does not include** obedience, saving faith **results in** obedience. If anyone attempts to teach that *"faith includes obedience,"* or that *"saving faith does not result in obedience"* they have just admitted that they have deviated from academically sound, historically time-tested Christianity.

> I believe saving faith will **result** in obedience... We must guard jealously the fact that **faith alone is what saves us, not faith plus obedience**. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge)</a> <sup><a href="#grudem">1</a></sup>

Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come **after justification**.

> **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.**
Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But **if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith**, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, **justifying faith (fiducia) is not yet ours**. &mdash; <a href="#packer">Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., Oxford)</a> <sup><a href="#packer">2</a></sup> -->

## Conclusion

This Order holds to a monergistic theology, which rejects works based forms of salvation, and holds to the biblically sound concept of sola fide or justification by faith alone, which once justified or saved, always results in obedience to God. Therefore, Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify.

<!-- This ministry holds to the most academically sound and historically time-tested theology known to Christendom. My position is known as the "historic Protestant" position which has been a sanctuary away from heresy for over 500 years. Justification by faith alone (*Sola fide*) has been a primary belief of Protestants since the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. -->

<!-- The 16th century Protestant Reformation saw the development of the five latin phrases, known as the Five solas, as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church. -->

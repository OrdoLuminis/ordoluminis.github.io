## On the Relation of Faith and Works

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
The Bible clearly states that we are saved by grace through faith apart from the works of the law.<sup>1</sup> The Bible also clearly warns that if we practice lifestyles of sin we will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<sup>2</sup> <strong>Protestants</strong> affirm both statements as true, applying regeneration<sup>3</sup>&mdash;and, at times, sanctification&mdash;instead of justification in their interpretation of the &ldquo;practice verses.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> In other words, the transformative process is seen as God's work in you, rather than an effort on your part to earn or merit salvation. The Holy Spirit produces the fruit, not human decision and efforts,<sup>5</sup> as a consequence of your new nature.<sup>6</sup> In essence, ‚Äúworks‚Äëfruit‚Äù not ‚Äúworks‚Äësalvation.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>Jesus replied, ‚ÄúI tell you the truth, unless you are born again [regenerated<sup>3</sup>], you cannot see the Kingdom of God.‚Äù</blockquote>

In contrast, a <a href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/identifying-the-cults-and-heretical-sects/">legalist</a> applies the concept of justification to the &ldquo;practice verses,&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> and rejects justification by grace through faith apart from works.<sup>1</sup> Meanwhile, an <a href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/identifying-the-cults-and-heretical-sects/">antinomian</a> denies the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles altogether on the &ldquo;practice verses,&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> adhering instead to a distorted interpretation of faith alone (i.e. a faith that is dead, disingenuine, and fruitless)<sup>7</sup> which has no historical basis within <strong>Protestantism</strong>.<br>

## Consensus Among Historic Creeds and Confessions of Protestantism

### Reformed Baptist & Presbyterian

#### John Calvin (1509-1564) was the first and most influential theologian in the Reformed tradition.

> Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time **sanctify**. ... Thus it is clear how true it is that **we are justified not without works yet not through works** (Calvin, 1960, 3.16.1).

> **It is therefore faith alone which justifies, and yet the faith which justifies is not alone** (Calvin, 2014, Canon 11).

#### Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) is the doctrinal standard for Presbyterian and Reformed churches.

> 11.2: Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification: **yet is not alone in the person justified**, but is ever accompanied with all the other saving graces, and **is no dead faith**, but worketh by love (Schaff, 2022, 3.2.16 "Confessio Fidei Westmonasteriensis").

### Lutheranism

#### Formula of Concord (1576) the great summary and consensus of Lutheran doctrine.

> III. & VIII. We believe, also teach, and confess that Faith alone is the means and instrument whereby we lay hold on Christ the Saviour ... after that man is justified by faith, then that true and living faith works by love, and **good works always follow justifying faith**, and are most certainly found together with it, provided only it be true and living faith. For **true faith is never alone** (Schaff, 2022, 3.1 "FORMULA CONCORDI√Ü").

### Anglican and Episcopalian

#### Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England (1571) doctrinal standard for Anglican and Episcopalian churches.

> XII. Of Good Works: Albeit that **Good Works, which are fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification**... do spring out necessarily of a true and lively faith... by them a lively Faith may be as **evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit** (Schaff, 2022, 3.2.10 "ARTICULI XXXIX. ECCLESI√Ü ANGLICAN√Ü").

### Baptist

#### New Hampshire Baptist Confession (1833) Statement for Baptist churches.

> VII. & VIII. Regeneration ... is effected ... by the power of the Holy Spirit ... **its proper evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance, and faith, and newness of life**. ... We believe that Repentance and Faith are sacred duties, and also inseparable graces, wrought in our souls by the regenerating Spirit of God; whereby being deeply convinced of our guilt, danger, and helplessness, and of the way of salvation by Christ, we turn to God with unfeigned contrition, confession, and supplication for mercy (Schaff, 2022, 3.3.2.2 "THE NEW HAMPSHIRE BAPTIST CONFESSION").

### Methodist

#### John Wesley (1703-1791) the founder of Methodism.

> We are, doubtless, justified by faith. This is the corner-stone of the whole Christian building. ... **So that if good works do not follow our faith**, even all inward and outward holiness, **it is plain our faith is nothing worth; we are yet in our sins** (Wesley, 1872, see Discourses‚ÄØI‚ÄìII; Sermons‚ÄØ35‚Äì36).

### Pentecostal

#### Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths (1916) one of the oldest and largest Pentecostal denominations.

> **Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ**. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being justified by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God, according to the hope of eternal life (Assemblies of God USA, n.d., sec. 5 "Conditions to Salvation" section).

> **The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness**. (Eph. 4:24; Titus 2:12) (Assemblies of God USA, n.d., sec. 5 "The Evidences of Salvation" section).


<!-- ## Modern Historic Protestants -->

<!-- Saving faith **does not include** obedience, saving faith **results in** obedience. If anyone attempts to teach that *"faith includes obedience,"* or that *"saving faith does not result in obedience"* they have just admitted that they have deviated from academically sound, historically time-tested Christianity.

> I believe saving faith will **result** in obedience... We must guard jealously the fact that **faith alone is what saves us, not faith plus obedience**. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge)</a> <sup><a href="#grudem">1</a></sup>

Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come **after justification**.

> **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.**
Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But **if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith**, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, **justifying faith (fiducia) is not yet ours**. &mdash; <a href="#packer">Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., Oxford)</a> <sup><a href="#packer">2</a></sup> -->

## Conclusion

This Order holds to a monergistic theology, which rejects works based forms of salvation, and holds to the biblically sound concept of sola fide or justification by faith alone, which once justified or saved, always results in obedience to God. Therefore, Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify.

<!-- This ministry holds to the most academically sound and historically time-tested theology known to Christendom. My position is known as the "historic Protestant" position which has been a sanctuary away from heresy for over 500 years. Justification by faith alone (*Sola fide*) has been a primary belief of Protestants since the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. -->

<!-- The 16th century Protestant Reformation saw the development of the five latin phrases, known as the Five solas, as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church. -->

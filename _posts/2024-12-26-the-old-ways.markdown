<sup>Apostolic Age Followers of “The Way” (ἡ ὁδός - hė hodós) c. AD 30 to c. AD 100 (1st Century). See Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22 (c. A.D. 61 &ndash; 64).</sup>

<!-- This is systemless Christianity directly from Christ and the Apostles. The terms **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** and **Χριστιανισμός (Christianismos)** refer to different periods and aspects of early Christianity:

- **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** – Followers of "The Way":
   - This term is associated with the **Apostolic Age**, which is the period during the lifetime of the apostles, roughly from the time of Jesus' resurrection (c. AD 30) to the death of the last apostle, John (c. AD 100). It was used to describe the early Christian movement in its initial stages.
   - Example: Acts 9:2, where Saul (later Paul) sought to persecute followers of "The Way."
   - See also: Acts 9:2 (c. AD 34-36); Acts 19:9 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 19:23 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 22:4 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:14 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:22 (c. AD 57)
</small> -->

The true Church has existed in every generation since the time of Christ, when He proclaimed, &ldquo;... upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it&rdquo; (New Living Translation, 2015, Matt. 16:18). Many generations have passed since Christ walked the earth over 20 centuries ago (2000+ years), but the truth has been with us since the very beginning.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> So I tell you, you are Peter <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>C</sup>the Greek petros, like the Aramaic cephas, means “rock” or “stone”]</span>. On this rock I will build my church, and the ·power of death <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup>gates of Hades/the underworld]</span> will not be able to ·defeat <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[overpower; conquer; prevail against]</span> it (Expanded Bible, 2011, Matt. 16:18).
>
>> The basis for Catholicism’s contention that the Church is built on Peter’s leadership is that his name means “stone.”<sup>14</sup> For sure there is wordplay going on in Peter’s confession, but I would suggest there is also an important double entendre: the “rock” refers to the mountain location where Jesus makes the statement. When viewed from this perspective, Peter confesses Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, at “this rock” (this mountain—Mount Hermon). Why? This place was considered the “gates of hell,” the gateway to the realm of the dead, in Old Testament times.<sup>15</sup>
>
>> The theological messaging couldn’t be more dramatic. Jesus says he will build his church—and the “gates of hell” will not prevail against it. We often think of this phrase as though God’s people are in a posture of having to bravely fend off Satan and his demons. This simply isn’t correct. Gates are defensive structures, not offensive weapons. The kingdom of God is the aggressor. <sup>16</sup> Jesus begins at ground zero in the cosmic geography of both testaments to announce the great reversal. It is the gates of hell that are under assault—and they will not hold up against the Church. Hell will one day be Satan’s tomb (Heiser, 2015, pp. 284-5).

Consider this: Do your current beliefs have roots in every generation since the time of Christ, or can you trace them only to a specific historical period? If your beliefs cannot be linked to earlier generations, they may be false, lacking the historical foundation that the true Church has upheld since Christ's declaration. The Word of God instructs us to turn to past generations in our pursuit of truth, assuring us that if we earnestly seek, we will find (Matt. 7:7-8):

> Remember **the days of old**; consider the years of many generations; ask your father, and he will show you, your elders, and they will tell you (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Deut. 32:7).

The challenge lies in the fact that many parents today are as adrift in contemporary movements as the children they have inadvertently misled. It is incumbent upon us to fulfill our duty by embracing the old ways and ancient paths, rather than succumbing to the ignorance of modernity. Ironically, biblical language scholarship and ecumenical academicians are on our side; more on that later.

> Thus says the Lord: “Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for **the ancient paths**, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’ (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Jeremiah 6:16).
>> This is what the Lord says: “Stop at the crossroads and look around. Ask for **the old, godly way**, and walk in it. Travel its path, and you will find rest for your souls. **But you reply, ‘No, that’s not the road we want!’** (New Living Translation, 2015, Jer. 6:16 NLT).

Christianity today is populated by individuals who have chosen to abandon the old ways and ancient paths, instead accumulating false teachers who entice them with **new things** and deceive them into believing they can live lifestyles of sin contrary to Scripture (1Jn 3:4-10; 5:18), all to satisfy their itching ears. In their pursuit of justifying their sin, they forsake the wisdom of the past, while those who remain steadfast in the ancient truths stand as a testament to genuine faith.

> For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear **new things**. And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, 2Tim. 4:3-4 NET).

The essential question then becomes: How can we shield ourselves from the "new things" that cultivate ignorance, lead to destruction, and ultimately result in apostasy? How can we be confident that we are adhering to the old ways and the ancient paths? One thing is certain: if we confine ourselves to a single point of view, we risk falling into an echo chamber of groupthink, where the blind lead the blind, pulling us into a quagmire of fables and ignorance (frequently propagated by contemporary movements). Dr. Heiser (2015), biblical language scholar and master of Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Egyptian, reveals:

> 1\. *We’ve been trained to think that the history of Christianity is the true context of the Bible*
>
> We talk a lot about interpreting the Bible in context, but Christian history is not
the context of the biblical writers. The proper context for interpreting the Bible is
not Augustine or any other church father. It is not the Catholic Church. It is not
the rabbinic movements of late antiquity and the Middle Ages. It is not the
Reformation or the Puritans. It is not evangelicalism in any of its flavors. **It is
not the modern world at all**, or any period of its history.
>
> The proper context for interpreting the Bible is the context of the biblical
writers&mdash;the context that produced the Bible [Second Temple period].<sup>1</sup> **Every other context is alien to the biblical writers and, therefore, to the Bible.** ... (p. 16).
>
> <small>1. We do not share the cognitive framework of the biblical writers. While the implications may seem uncomfortable, it is hermeneutically pointless to pretend otherwise. ... (p. 16).</small>


<!-- Yet there is a pervasive tendency in<br>
the believing Church to filter the Bible through creeds, confessions, and<br>
denominational preferences.
>
> <span style="margin-left:2.3em;">I’m not arguing that we should ignore our Christian forefathers. I’m simply</span><br>
saying that we should give their words and their thought the proper perspective<br>
and priority. Creeds serve a useful purpose. They distill important, albeit<br>
carefully selected, theological ideas. But they are not inspired. They are no<br>
substitute for the biblical text.
>
> The biblical text was produced by men who lived in the ancient Near East<br>
and Mediterranean between the second millennium BC and the first century AD.<br>
To understand how biblical writers thought, we need to tap into the intellectual<br>
output of that world. A vast amount of that material is available to us, thanks to<br>
modern technology. As our understanding of the worldview of the biblical<br>
writers grows, so does our understanding of what they intended to say—and the<br>
mosaic of their thinking takes shape in our minds (p. 16). -->

It's clear that the late Dr. Heiser spent vast amounts of time traversing the old ways and ancient paths. A comparable and earlier admonition can be found in the writings of the Apostle Paul, who cautions against labeling ourselves after specific leaders. This guidance is articulated in the following scripture:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV Study Bible, 2008, 1Cor. 1:12-13)

Paul's point here is to emphasize unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. If you label yourselves with Catholicism (of the Pope), **Luther**anism (of Martin Luther), **Calvin**ism (of John Calvin), **Arminian**ism (of Jacobus Arminius), **Wesley**anism (of John Wesley), **Amyra**ldism (of Moses Amyraut), **Mol**inism (Luis de Molina), **Chafer**anism (of Lewis Sperry Chafer), you are going directly against the word of God and **your doctrine is not sound**. The Bible warns that some of these people **may** have created divisions because they are devoid of the spirit:

> These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because **they do not have God’s Spirit in them** (New Living Translation, 2015, Jude 19).

If you find yourself ensnared in one of the numerous man-made systematic theologies that are rife with errors and various &lsquo;isms that contradict the inspired Word of God, I urge you to **turn away** from these deviations in the unfeigned contrition of repentance and **return to sound doctrine**. The Bible instructs us to **&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;** for you have only one teacher, Christ Jesus, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters (New Living Translation, 2015, Matt. 23:8-9 NLT). At the very least, backup into basic protestant solas without the 'isms.

> You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and do so correctly, for that is what I am (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, John 13:13 NET).

> “Don’t let anyone call you ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters. And don’t address anyone here on earth as ‘Father,’ for only God in heaven is your Father (New Living Translation, 2015, Matt. 23:8-9 NLT).

Teachers who promote man-made systems are the epitome of the teaching of the blind guides. The scriptures tell us to flee from them!

> Leave them! They are blind guides. If someone who is blind leads another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.” (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, Matt. 15:14 NET)

It's time for many of us to pull our heads out of the theological sand. It's time for us to give the Bible another chance. **The world can never know God through human wisdom**. Remember that men are not meant to interpret scripture for you&mdash;that right belongs to the Holy Spirit (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14). Instead, open your Bible and fellowship with Christ.

> But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and **you have no need that anyone should teach you**. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, **abide in him** (ESV Study Bible, 2008, 1John 2:27; cf. John 15:4-5 ESV).
>
>> But you have received the Holy Spirit, and he lives within you, so you don’t need anyone to teach you what is true. For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know, and what he teaches is true—it is not a lie. So just as he has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ (New Living Translation, 2015, 1John 2:27).

> And we impart this in words **not taught by human wisdom** but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. (ESV Study Bible, 2008, 1Cor 2:13)

> So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and **the world’s** brilliant debaters? God has made **the wisdom of this world** look foolish. Since **God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom**, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe (New Living Translation, 2015, 1 Cor 1:20-21 NLT).

In unity, let us distance ourselves from the misleading teachings and philosophies of this world, and instead turn towards the Scriptures, and secondly, to the faithful educators of Scripture who do not indoctrinate us into man-made systems. Dr. Heiser (2021) exemplifies the faithful *didaskalos* when he stated:

> "This is why the Scripture says what it says. Now again, **I don't care how that fits into your system**. Okay, I really don't. **We don't need systems**. We need to pay attention to the text, and we need to be consistent across the Testaments. That's what we need" (8:38-49).

<!-- (Heiser, 2021, 8:46) -->

I strongly advocate for, and highly recommend, prioritizing direct engagement with Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit (1 John 2:27), supported by high-quality scholarly resources, over adherence to rigid theological systems. The Bible cautions against the divisiveness inherent in man-made systems and promotes a more personal, less doctrinally divided approach to faith. The hierarchy of authority presented in the Bible underscores the importance of divine guidance and the original biblical texts (via biblical language scholarship), placing them above human interpretations and systematic theology. **Bibles, lexicons, interlinears, and textual criticism are all you need to bridge the language gap, and Christ is your only teacher.** **Being systemless does not mean being theology-less or churchless.** Here are my recommendations:

<!-- ## Navigating the Seas of Time

Now, I shall digress. Let us embark on a quest to explore the old ways and ancient paths by first charting the course of history to discern what can be classified as old and new. The first two groups are viewed as sanctuaries of truth: **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** is primarily associated with the Apostolic Age, while **Χριστιανισμός (Christianismos)** is more associated with the Ante-Nicene Period.

### 1. Apostolic Age Followers of “The Way” (ἡ ὁδός - hė hodós)
#### c. AD 30 to c. AD 100 (1st Century)

This is systemless Christianity directly from Christ and the Apostles. The terms **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** and **Χριστιανισμός (Christianismos)** refer to different periods and aspects of early Christianity:

- **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** – Followers of "The Way":
   - This term is associated with the **Apostolic Age**, which is the period during the lifetime of the apostles, roughly from the time of Jesus' resurrection (c. AD 30) to the death of the last apostle, John (c. AD 100). It was used to describe the early Christian movement in its initial stages.
   - Example: Acts 9:2, where Saul (later Paul) sought to persecute followers of "The Way."
   - See also: Acts 9:2 (c. AD 34-36); Acts 19:9 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 19:23 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 22:4 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:14 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:22 (c. AD 57) -->

<!-- - Jesus & The Apostles (1st Century): The teachings of Jesus Christ and the writings of the Apostles recorded in the New Testament, which form the foundation of Christian doctrine and belief.

    - Taught trustful belief as justifying: (Rom. 3:28; Eph 2:8-9; Jn 3:16; 5:24; 6:47; 11:25-26; Lk 8:12).
    - Taught repentance alongside faith (Mk 1:15; Lk 13:3; Mt 4:17; Rev 2:5,16,22; 3:3,19) as a turning away (Acts 3:26; cf. Acts 3:19) brought on by Godly sorrow (2 Cor. 7:10). This is corroborated as “feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense),” according to our most authoritative Greek lexicons. Jesus describes repentance the same as in the OT (Mt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
    - Taught “resulting” fruit-bearing (Jn 15:1-17; Mt 7:15-20; 13:1-23; Mk 4:1-20; Lk 6:43-45).
    - Taught “resulting” obedience: (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

  - Jesus (c. 6/4 BC – c. AD 30/33).
  - Peter (c. 1 – AD 64/68)
  - Andrew (c. 5/6 – AD 100)
  - James, son of Zebedee (c. 1 – AD 44)
  - John (c. 6 – c. AD 100)
  - Philip (Died c. 80 AD)
  - Bartholomew (Died c. 69/71)
  - Matthew
  - Thomas (Died AD 72)
  - James, son of Alphaeus
  - Jude (Died c. AD 65)
  - Simon the Zealot (Died ~AD 65)
  - Judas Iscariot (Died AD 31)
  - Matthias (Died c. AD 80)
  - Paul (c. 5 - 64/67 AD)
  - Barnabas (Unknown)
  - James, the Lord's brother (Died c. AD 62–69)
  - see Galatians 1:19
  - Andronicus (Unknown)
  see Romans 16:7
  - Junia (Unknown)
  see Romans 16:7
  - Apollos (Died c. AD 100)
  - Epaphroditus (Died Unknown)
  see Philippians 2:25 -->

<!-- ### 2. Ante-Nicene Period Christianity (Χριστιανισμός)
#### c. AD 100 to AD 325

- **Χριστιανισμός (Christianismos)** – Christianity:
   - This term, and the related term **Χριστιανός (Christianos)** meaning "Christian," became more common in the **Ante-Nicene Period**, which extends from the end of the Apostolic Age (c. AD 100) to the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325. By this time, the term "Christian" had become widely accepted as the standard designation for followers of Jesus Christ.
   - Example: Acts 11:26, where the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
   - See also: Acts 11:26 (c. AD 47-48); Acts 26:28 (c. AD 59-60); 1 Peter 4:16 (c. AD 64-65). -->

### 2. Ancient Catholic Orthodoxy (Council of Nicaea, 325; Council of Constantinople, 381)
### 3. Roman Catholicism (Development of papal authority, 5th-8th centuries)
### 4. Eastern Orthodoxy (Great Schism, 1054)
### 5. Protestantism (Luther's 95 Theses, 1517; Augsburg Confession, 1530)
#### 5a. Lutheranism (Formation of the Lutheran Church, 1520s; Book of Concord, 1580)
### 6. Counter-Reformation (Council of Trent, 1545–1563)
### 7. Calvinism (Calvin's Writings, 1536; Synod of Dort, 1618–1619)
### 8. Arminianism (Remonstrance, 1610; Synod of Dort, 1618–1619)
### 9. Baptist (First Baptist Church, 1609; Philadelphia Confession, 1742)
### 10. Methodism (Founding of the Methodist movement, 1738; General Conference, 1784)
### 11. Pentecostalism (Azusa Street Revival, 1906; Formation of the Assemblies of God, 1914)
### 12. Contemporary Movements -->

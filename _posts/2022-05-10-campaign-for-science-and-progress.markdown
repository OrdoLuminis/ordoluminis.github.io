Christians have established a formidable presence in the realm of science, a triumph that we must ardently defend and perpetuate for future generations. From Newton, Leibniz, and Maxwell to Kistiakowsky and Polkinghorne, Protestants have dominated the sciences as well as the Nobel Prize for hundreds of years. This excellence can also be traced to the ancient past. Moses' secular Egyptian education in the Egyptian court provided him with leadership, writing, and strategic thinking skills&mdash;qualities that would later be crucial for his role in leading the Israelites (Acts 7:22). Similarly, Daniel's secular Babylonian education prepared him and his companions for influential positions within a secular government (Daniel 1:4-5). God intentionally placed Daniel in an environment that valued broader learning beyond just religious instruction, granting him the knowledge and skills necessary for significant secular influence&mdash;all while he maintained his steadfast faith. It is our responsibility to continue this legacy.</p>

<!-- From Moses' secular Egyptian education in the Egyptian court, which equipped him with skills in leadership, writing, and strategic thinking which were vital for the future role in leading the israelites (Acts 7:22), to Daniel's secular Babylonian education which prepared Daniel and his friends for a prominent role in a secular government (Dan. 1:4-5). It is up to us to carry on this legacy! -->

<!-- > So Moses was trained in **all the wisdom of the Egyptians** and was powerful in his words and deeds (NET Bible, 2019, Acts 7:22). -->


<!-- Daniel and his friends were educated in the language and literature of the Babylonians. God placed Daniel in a setting that emphasized learning beyond religious instruction, giving him access to knowledge that would prepare him for a prominent role in a secular government while maintaining his faith. -->

<!-- > “Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. **“Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment**, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon.[a]” 5 The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens. They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal service (New Living Translation, 2015, Dan. 1:4-5). -->

<!-- According to 100 Years of Nobel Prize (2005), a review of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000, 65.4% of Nobel Prize Laureates have identified Christianity as their religious preference (427 prizes). Overall, Christians have won a total of 78.3% of all the Nobel Prizes in Peace, 72.5% in Chemistry, 65.3% in Physics, 62% in Medicine, 54% in Economics. -->

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
In a profound analysis conducted by Dr. Baruch Shalev (2001/2002), a geneticist from the University of Reading, it is revealed that between 1901 and 2000, an astonishing 65.4% of Nobel Prize laureates were either Christians or hailed from a Christian background, illuminating the indelible influence of Christian thought on the pinnacle of human achievement. Among these luminaries, an extraordinary 78.3% of Nobel laureates in Peace, 72.5% in Chemistry, 65.3% in Physics, 62% in Medicine, 54% in Economics, and 49.5% in Literature proudly identified as Christians or possessed Christian roots. This remarkable representation not only underscores the monumental contributions of these intellectual titans but also celebrates their pivotal role in shaping the course of human progress and enlightenment.</p>

> A review of the Nobel awards between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 654 Laureates belong to 28 different religions. Most (65.4%) have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference. While separating Roman Catholic from Protestants among Christians proved difficult in some cases, available information suggests that **more Protestants were involved in the scientific categories** and more Catholics were involved in the Literature and Peace categories (p. 57).

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626</span>

The 17th century scientist and philosopher of science who is credited with discovering and popularizing the scientific method, whereby the laws of science are discovered by gathering and analyzing data from experiments and observations. Bacon was a devout Christian.

<!-- (4 January 1643 to 31 March 1727) -->


Isaac Newton stands as one of the most brilliant intellects in history, credited with achieving <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">the First Great Unification in physics</span> and independently developing Calculus alongside Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. His seminal work, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, is regarded as one of the most significant contributions to the field of science. Additionally, Newton was a deeply devout Christian. Isaac Newton was raised in the Church of England, an Anglican denomination within the broader Protestant tradition.

<!-- Isaac Newton is one of the greatest minds the word has ever produced. responsible for the ***The First Great Unification in physics, and the invention of Calculus*** independently from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

The following are direct quotes from Sir Isaac Newton:

> "God created everything by number, weight and measure" (Jean & Barabé, 1998, p. xxxvii).

> This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the centres of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise counsel, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all the other systems: and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other, he hath placed those systems at immense distances from one another.
>
> This Being<sup>1</sup> governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called Lord God παντοκρáτωρ ["pantokrator"], or Universal Ruler; (Newton, 1934, p. 544).

Nevertheless, criticism was passed upon the Principia, on theological grounds, by two prominent thinkers, Bishop Berkeley, who in 1710 published his Principles of Human Knowledge, and Leibniz, who on February 10, 1711, wrote a letter to Hartsoeker, a Dutch physician at Diisseldorf, which was published on May 5,1712, in the Memoirs of Literature, a weekly sold in London<sup>1</sup> (Newton, 1934, p. 668).</small>

<!-- Created calculus independently from Newton and [autodidactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autodidacts), and paved the way for Einstein’s theory of relativity. Einstein, who called himself a “Leibnizian” even wrote that Leibnizianism was superior to Newtonianism, and his ideas would have dominated over Newton’s had it not been for the poor technological tools of the time. -->

Leibniz developed calculus independently of Newton through self-directed study ([autodidactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autodidacts)), paving the way for Einstein's theory of relativity. Einstein, who referred to himself as a "Leibnizian," wrote that Leibnizianism was superior to Newtonianism, asserting that Leibniz's ideas would have dominated over Newton's had it not been for the technological limitations of the time. Leibniz was a Protestant and Trinitarian. Leibniz devoted considerable intellectual and diplomatic effort to what would now be called an ecumenical endeavor, seeking to reconcile the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches.

<!-- > We never have a full demonstration, although there is always an underlying reason for the truth, even if **it is only perfectly understood by God, who alone penetrated the infinite series in one stroke of the mind** (Strickland, 2006). -->

<!-- > Perhaps never has a man read as much, studied as much, meditated more, and written more than Leibniz ... What he has composed on the world, God, nature, and the soul is of the most sublime eloquence. If his ideas had been expressed with the flair of Plato, the philosopher of Leipzig would cede nothing to the philosopher of Athens. &mdash; Denis Diderot, Oeuvres complètes, vol. 7, p. 709, quoted in "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz" (2013) by Brandon C. Look

> It was thus that Leibnitz saw in his binary arithmetic the image of creation. He imagined that Unity represented God, and Zero the void; and that the Supreme Being drew all beings from the void, just as unity and zero express all numbers in this system of numeration. &mdash; Pierre-Simon Laplace, Essai Philosophique sur les Probabilitésas (1814) p. 82, partially quoted in Tobias Dantzig, Number: The Language of Science (1930) p. 15 and in Richard Courant, Herbert Robbins What is Mathematics? (1941) revised by Ian Stewart (1996)

The following are direct quotes from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: -->

> In contingent propositions, however, the analysis continues to infinity through reasons of reasons, so that we never have a full demonstration, although there is always an underlying reason for the truth, even if **it is only perfectly understood by God, who alone penetrates an infinite series in one stroke of the mind** (Strickland, 2006, p. 111).

> Every substance is as a world apart, independent of everything else except God (Leibniz, 1993).

> In whatever manner God created the world, it would always have been regular and in a certain general order. God, however, has chosen the most perfect, that is to say, the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypothesis and the richest in phenomena (Leibniz, 1993).

<!-- > If there were no best among all possible worlds, God would not have created one. -->

> 8\. Now this supreme wisdom, united to a goodness that is no less infinite, cannot but have chosen the best. For as a lesser evil is a kind of good, even so a lesser good is a kind of evil if it stands in the way of a greater good; and there would be something to correct in the actions of God if it were possible to do better. As in mathematics, when there is no maximum nor minimum, in short nothing distinguished, everything is done equally, or when that is not possible nothing at all is done: so it may be said likewise in respect of perfect wisdom, which is no less orderly than mathematics, that **if there were not the best (optimum) among all possible worlds, God would not have produced any [created one].** I call ‘World’ the whole succession and the whole agglomeration of all existent things, lest it be said that several worlds could have existed in different times and different places. For they must needs be reckoned all together as one world or, if you will, as one Universe. And even though one should fill all times and all places, it still remains true that one might have filled them in innumerable ways, and that there is an infinitude of possible worlds among which God must needs have chosen the best, since he does nothing without acting in accordance with supreme reason (Leibniz, 2007, p. 131).

> But I have much stronger reasons for thinking so, since the religion I follow closely assures me that **the love of God consists in an ardent desire to procure the general welfare, and reason teaches me that there is nothing which contributes more to the general welfare of mankind than the perfection of reason** (Leibniz, 1951, p. 17).

> 53\. Now as **there is an infinity of possible universes in the ideas of God, and as only one of them can exist, there must be a sufficient reason for God’s choice**, determining him to one rather than to another.
>
> 54\. And this reason can only be found in the fittingness, or in the degrees of perfection, which these worlds contain, each possible world having the right to claim existence in proportion to the perfection it contains. [Thus there is nothing which is wholly arbitrary.] (Leibniz, 2014, pp. 24-25).

<!-- Leibniz famously tried to show that ours is the best of all possible worlds (see also Monadologie (53 & 54) below and compare Maimonides from Guide for the Perplexed (c. 1190), "Whatever is formed of matter receives the most perfect form possible in that species of matter.") These attempts were mercilessly parodied in Voltaire's Candide. Quotations from Voltaire's novel are often mistakenly attributed to Leibniz. Other statements by Leibniz upon the subject include these: -->

## <a name="faraday" href="#Contents">Michael Faraday</a>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">22 September 1791 – 25 August 1867</span>

![Portrait of Faraday](/assets/images/science/Faraday%20(1842).jpg)

<sup>Phillips, T. (1842). *Michael Faraday* [Painting]. National Portrait Gallery.</sup>

The greatest self-taught experimental physicist, and one of the most influential scientists in history. Albert Einstein kept a picture of Michael Faraday on his study wall, alongside pictures of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell at his apartment in Berlin, Germany.

> Faraday found no conflict between his religious beliefs and his activities as a scientist and philosopher. He viewed his discoveries of nature's laws as part of the continual process of "reading the book of nature", no different in principle from the process of reading the Bible to discover God's laws. A strong sense of the unity of God and nature pervaded Faraday's life and work (Baggot, 1991).

The following are direct quotes from Michael Faraday:

> **The book of nature which we have to read is written by the finger of God** (Faraday, 1859, p. 471).

> To his old friend Auguste de la Rive, Professor of Physics at Geneva University, and a correspondent for 30 years, Faraday’s religious faith came most strongly to the surface: hope for a life to come comforted his final years:
>
> I cannot tell when I wrote you last. Of late years I have kept a note, but I suppose I have forgotten to note. Having no science to talk to you about, a motive, which was very strong in former times, is now wanting. But your last letter reminds me of another motive, which I hope is stronger than science with both of us, and that is the future life which lies before us. I am, I hope, very thankful that in the withdrawal of the powers and things of this life, the good hope is left with me, which makes the contemplation of death a comfort-not a fear. **Such peace is alone in the gift of God, and as it is He who gives it, why should we be afraid? His unspeakable gift in His beloved Son** is the ground of no doubtful hope, and there is the rest for those who (like you and me) are drawing near the latter end of our terms here below. I do not know, however, why I should join you with me in years. I forget your age. But this I know (and feel as well) that next Sabbath day (the 22nd) I shall complete my 70th year. I can hardly think myself so old as I write to you-so much of cheerful spirit, ease and general health is left to me, and if my memory fails, why it causes that I forget troubles as well as pleasure and the end is, I am happy and content (Faraday, 1999, p. 199).

The illustrious Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Max Planck, stands as a towering figure in the annals of science, renowned for his groundbreaking role in the establishment of quantum physics—a pivotal advancement that transformed our understanding of the natural world. A devout Christian, Planck was a dedicated member of the Lutheran Church in Germany, embodying a profound synthesis of faith and scientific inquiry. His contributions not only reshaped the landscape of modern physics but also left an indelible mark on the intellectual heritage of humanity.

> “Both religion and science require a belief in God. For believers, God is in the beginning, and for physicists He is at the end of all considerations… To the former He is the foundation, to the latter, the crown of the edifice of every generalized world view.”
>
> “There can never be any real opposition between religion and science; for the one is the complement of the other. Every serious and reflective person realizes, I think, that the religious element in his nature must be recognized and cultivated if all the powers of the human soul are to act together in perfect balance and harmony. And indeed it was not by accident that the greatest thinkers of all ages were deeply religious souls.”

Religion and Natural Science (Lecture Given 1937) Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, trans. F. Gaynor (New York, 1949), pp. 184

Planck said in 1944,

> "As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent spirit [orig. geist]. This spirit is the matrix of all matter."

Joseph John Thomson was a renowned English physicist who made groundbreaking contributions to the understanding of atomic structure. His discovery of the electron in 1897 revealed that cathode rays consisted of tiny, negatively charged particles with a high charge-to-mass ratio. Thomson also discovered the first evidence of isotopes in a stable element in 1913, while studying canal rays. His work with Francis William Aston on positively charged particles led to the development of mass spectrometry and the mass spectrograph. Thomson's achievements were recognized with the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on the conduction of electricity in gases.

Gödel was a Christian. He believed that God was personal, and called his philosophy "rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and theological"

> "My theory is rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and theological” — Kurt Friedrich Gödel

> Gödel believed firmly in an afterlife, saying, "Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which today's science and received wisdom haven't any inkling of. But I am convinced of this [the afterlife], independently of any theology." It is "possible today to perceive, by pure reasoning" that it "is entirely consistent with known facts." "If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning, then there must be such a thing [as an afterlife]."

> In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as "baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is theistic, not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than Spinoza." Of religion(s) in general, he said: "Religions are, for the most part, bad—but religion is not".

“God deliberately reduced Himself to the stature of humanity in order to visit the earth in person, because the cumulative effect over the centuries of millions of individuals choosing to please themselves rather than God had infected the whole planet. When God became a man Himself, the experience proved to be nothing short of pure agony.

He was a professor in the Mathematics Department at Princeton University (New York Encounter, n.d.). Nelson was a devout Christian who believed in, prayed to, and worshipped God (Magis Center, n.d.). He explored the relationship between mathematics and faith, authoring works such as Mathematics and Faith, where he reflected on the human search for truth in mathematics and its connection to faith (Math at Princeton, n.d.). In his essay Confessions of an Apostate Mathematician, Nelson questioned the semantics of mathematics and its existential aspects, contemplating the role of faith in understanding mathematical truths (Math at Princeton, n.d.). Nelson's philosophical and theological reflections influenced his mathematical work, particularly in areas like internal set theory and non-standard analysis. His perspective was that the dwelling place of meaning is syntax, and that semantics is the home of illusion (Math at Princeton, n.d.).

Francis S. Collins, a prominent geneticist and former director of the National Institutes of Health, identifies as a Christian who embraces theistic evolution, viewing scientific understanding as complementary to his faith. Raised in an agnostic family, Collins considered himself agnostic by graduate school. His perspective began to shift after a conversation with a hospital patient prompted him to question his lack of religious views. This led him to investigate various faiths and explore the evidence for and against God, particularly in cosmology. On the recommendation of a Methodist minister, he read Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis, which became foundational in developing his religious views. Collins believes that conversion to Christianity involves more than reason and argument, requiring a "leap of faith" as the final step. After several years of deliberation, he converted to Christianity during a trip to the Cascade Mountains, where a striking image of a frozen waterfall removed his final resistance, leading to his conversion the following morning. Throughout his journey, Collins has been associated with various denominations, including Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and Episcopalian, emphasizing that denominational differences are not essential to him. He is known for advocating the harmony between science and faith, notably through his foundation, BioLogos, which promotes the integration of science and Christian faith (Wikipedia, n.d.).

Very ingeniously these manifestation of Jesus is to our minds difficult to penetrate. (He appears) as a gardener. The gardener plants seedlings in prepared soil. The soil must exert a physical and chemical influence so that the seed of the plant can grow. Yet this is not sufficient. The warmth and light of the sun must be added, together with rain, in order that growth may result. The seed of supernatural life, of sanctifying grace, cleanses from sin, so preparing the soul of man, and man must seek to preserve this life by his good works.

So natural and supernatural must unite to the realization of the holiness to the people. Man must contribute his minimum work of toil, and God gives the growth.

Chapter 5 : The Influences That Shape Our Destiny

The gift of mental power comes from God, Divine Being, and if we concentrate our minds on that truth, we become in tune with this great power. My Mother had taught me to seek all truth in the Bible.

Einstein’s theory of general relativity comprises the finalization of Newton’s assumption of gravitation and further encompasses Mach’s vision of the relativity of all motion; his theory of special relativity incorporates the finalization of the work of Maxwell and Lorentz. **While Einstein didn't believe in a personal God, he did believe in a God.** Einstein (called himself a “Leibnizian,” and was also a Spinozist)

> "The more I study science, the more I believe in God."
>
"The fanatical atheists are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who – in their grudge against traditional religion as the ‘opium of the masses’ – cannot hear the music of the spheres."
>
“I’m not an atheist, and I don’t think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the books but doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God.” (Albert Einstein, as cited in Antony Flew’s book, There Is A God: How the World’s Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind.)
>
"I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know his thoughts; the rest are details."
>
“As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene . . . . No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life. Jesus is too colossal for the pen of phrase-mongers, however artful. No man can dispose of Christianity with a bon mot.” (Albert Einstein, as cited in “What Life Means to Einstein,” The Saturday Evening Post, October 26, 1929.)
>
“Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe–a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.”
>
“In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views.” (Clark, Ronald W. (1971). Einstein: The Life and Times. New York: World Publishing Company)

![Portrait of Ernst Boris Chain](/assets/images/science/Chain%20(1945).webp)

Winner of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology

> "To postulate, as the positivists of the end of the 19th century and their followers here have done,
that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations,
or even that nature carries out experiments by trial and error through mutations in order to create living systems better fitted to survive,
seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconcilable with the facts."

## <a name="kaku" href="#Contents">Michio Kaku</a>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">January 24, 1947</span>

Theoretical physicist and string theory pioneer.

> “I have concluded that we are in a world made by rules created by an intelligence. Believe me, everything that we call chance today won’t make sense anymore. To me it is clear that we exist in a plan which is governed by rules that were created, shaped by a universal intelligence and not by chance.”

> "Physics says nothing about where the laws of physics themselves come from. So the cosmological proof of Saint Thomas Aquinas concerning the First Mover or First Cause is left relevant even today." &mdash; The God Equation

## <a name="schrodinger" href="#Contents">Erwin Schrödinger</a>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">12 August 1887 – 4 January 1961</span>

Winner of the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics “for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory.”

> “Science is a game – but a game with reality, a game with sharpened knives. If a man cuts a picture carefully into 1000 pieces, you solve the puzzle when you reassemble the pieces into a picture; in the success or failure, both your intelligences compete. In the presentation of a scientific problem, the other player is the good Lord. He has not only set the problem but also has devised the rules of the game – but they are not completely known, half of them are left for you to discover or to deduce. The **uncertainty** is how many of the rules God himself has permanently **ordained**, and how many apparently are caused by your own mental inertia, while the solution generally becomes possible only through **freedom** from its limitations. This is perhaps the most exciting thing in the game.”

## <a name="darwin" href="#Contents">Charles Darwin</a>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882</span>

> “Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with the reason and not with the feelings, impresses me as having much more weight. This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with his capacity of looking far backwards and far into futurity, as the result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting I feel compelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some degree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.”
&mdash; Charles Darwin, the founder of evolutionary biology, as quoted in his autobiography.
>
"The question of whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the Universe has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed."
&mdash; Charles Darwin, the founder of evolutionary biology, as cited in his book Descent of Man.
>
"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances,
for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration,
could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I confess, absurd in the highest degree...
The difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection,
though insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered subversive of the theory."
&mdash; Charles Darwin
>
"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous,
successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down."
&mdash; Origin of Species



## Galileo Galilei

Astronomer, physicist, engineer, mathematician and philosopher who made fundamental contributions to the sciences of motion, astronomy, and strength of materials and to the development of the scientific method. His formulation of (circular) inertia, the law of falling bodies, and parabolic trajectories marked the beginning of a fundamental change in the study of motion.

<!-- His insistence that the book of nature was written in the language of mathematics changed natural philosophy from a verbal, qualitative account to a mathematical one in which experimentation became a recognized method for discovering the facts of nature. Finally, his discoveries with the telescope revolutionized astronomy and paved the way for the acceptance of the Copernican heliocentric system, but his advocacy of that system eventually resulted in an Inquisition process against him. -->

> “Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe”

> "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use ..." &mdash; Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina (1615)

> Nature … is inexorable and immutable; she never transgresses the laws imposed upon her, or cares a whit whether her abstruse reasons and methods of operation are understandable to men. For that reason it appears that nothing physical which sense-experience sets before our eyes, or which necessary demonstrations prove to us, ought to be called in question (much less condemned) upon the testimony of biblical passages which may have some different meaning beneath their words. For the Bible is not chained in every expression to conditions as strict as those which govern all physical effects; nor is God any less excellently revealed in Nature's actions than in the sacred statements of the Bible. &mdash; Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina (1615)

<!-- Essay published in 1615, in response to enquiries of Christina of Tuscany, as quoted in Aspects of Western Civilization : Problems and Sources in History (1988) by Perry McAdow Rogers, p. 53 -->

> Surely, God could have caused birds to fly with their bones made of solid gold, with their veins full of quicksilver, with their flesh heavier than lead, and with their wings exceedingly small. He did not, and that ought to show something. It is only in order to shield your ignorance that you put the Lord at every turn to the refuge of a miracle. &mdash; Notes in a copy of Jean-Baptiste Morin's "Famous and ancient problems of the earth's motion or rest, yet to be solved" (published 1631), as quoted in The Crime of Galileo (1976) by Giorgio De Santillana, p. 167

> "... So help me God, and these His Holy Gospels, which I touch with my hands." &mdash; Recantation (22 June 1633) as quoted in The Crime of Galileo (1955) by Giorgio de Santillana, p. 312.

> Philosophy is written in this grand book, which stands continually open before our eyes (I say the 'Universe'), but can not be understood without first learning to comprehend the language and know the characters as it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and its characters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures, without which it is impossible to humanly understand a word; without these one is wandering in a dark labyrinth. &mdash; Il Saggiatore, 1623

<!-- > Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes, I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols, in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth. &mdash; The Assayer (1623), as translated by Thomas Salusbury (1661), p. 178, as quoted in The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science (2003) by Edwin Arthur Burtt, p. 75. -->

<!-- > Philosophy is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth. &mdash; As translated in The Philosophy of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1966) by Richard Henry Popkin, p. 65 -->

> To give us the science of motion God and Nature have joined hands and created the intellect of Galileo. &mdash; Paolo Sarpi, Editor's Preface to Dialogues and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences by Galileo (1638) Crew and De Salvio translation (1914)


## Nicolaus Copernicus

The mathematician and astronomer (1473-1543) who formulated a heliocentric model of the universe, as cited in The Language of God by Francis Collins. (“Heliocentric” places the sun, rather than the Earth, at the center of the universe).

> “To know the mighty works of God, to comprehend His wisdom and majesty and power; to appreciate, in degree, the wonderful workings of His laws, surely all this must be a pleasing and acceptable mode of worship to the Most High, to whom ignorance cannot be more grateful than knowledge.”

<!-- # Campaign for Science and Progress

![InfinityEmblem](/assets/OrdoDeiInvictusInsigniaInfinityGold.png)

Christians have established a formidable presence in the realm of science, a triumph that we must ardently defend and perpetuate for future generations. From Newton, Leibniz, and Maxwell to Kistiakowsky and Polkinghorne, [Protestants have dominated the sciences as well as the Nobel Prize for hundreds of years](https://deiinvictus.com/posts/protestants-dominate-the-sciences/). This excellence can also be traced to the ancient past. It is up to us to carry on this legacy!

### Moses' Egyptian Education

Moses' secular education in the Egyptian court equipped him with skills in leadership, writing, and strategic thinking that were vital for the future role in leading the israelites.

> So Moses was trained in **all the wisdom of the Egyptians** and was powerful in his words and deeds (NET Bible, 2019, Acts 7:22).

### Daniel's Babylonian Education

Daniel and his friends were educated in the language and literature of the Babylonians. God placed Daniel in a setting that emphasized learning beyond religious instruction, giving him access to knowledge that would prepare him for a prominent role in a secular government while maintaining his faith.

> “Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. **“Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment**, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon.[a]” 5 The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens. They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal service (New Living Translation, 2015, Dan. 1:4-5). -->

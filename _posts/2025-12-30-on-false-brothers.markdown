<!-- ## How the Rotten Fruit of False Brothers Turned Me Toward Reformed Theology -->

<!-- <p style="text-indent:2em;">In all things in life I was the hardest worker that I know. I excelled and succeeded in everything I attempted to do&mdash;whether it was physically, in my perseverance with exercise; spiritually, as an ascetic of twenty years; intellectually, as an autodidact; and recently as an academic four-point physicist. The Lord blessed me and continues to bless me in all that I do.</p> -->

<!-- <blockquote>
I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. <strong>It is all decided by chance</strong>, by being in the right place at the right time (New Living Translation, 2015, Ecc. 9:11).
</blockquote> -->

<!-- <p style="text-indent:2em;">During this chain of events, financial strain crept upon my life due to a choice in my youth to follow Christ through asceticism.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> As time went on and I became a man I grew in wisdom and understanding beyond all of my peers. During this phase there was an attempt to stabilize my finances and help a friend retire. The success caused a great stir of jealousy, anger, and resentment in those who I thought were family and friends. However, when the money was stolen, these same people attacked me viciously as if they had been waiting for me to fall my entire life&mdash;the faithless, the quitters, the greedy, and the intolerant, who I thought I had prayed back to Christianity, were now viciously <a class="alterlink" href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/on-envy-and-jealousy/">attacking</a> me. Echoing King David's experiences, many I once regarded as friends, and even family, betrayed me, repaying good with evil.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> To make things worse, every person who mocked me, and kicked me while I was down was also a so-called professing "Christian" from a contemporary movement. I am reminded of the struggles and stress of both the Lord himself, who sweat drops of blood, and of the Apostle Paul who were both betrayed by false brothers just as I have been and continue to endure:</p> -->

## The Tale of the Unyielding Servant

<p style="text-indent:2em;">In the annals of mortal striving there lived a man whose very name became synonymous with relentless toil. He was the hardest worker the world had ever known, and his deeds shone in every arena he entered: he forged his body through ceaseless exercise, each movement a quiet testament to his perseverance; for twenty long years he walked the ascetic path,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> denying comfort to draw nearer to the Divine; as an autodidact he devoured knowledge as a ravenous fire and later mastered formal education, conquering both self‑directed study and institutional learning; and at last he rose to the lofty rank of scientist, his mind probing the very fabric of creation. The Lord, seeing such devotion, blessed him abundantly, and the blessings continued to flow like a river unbroken.

Yet, the seed of his early ascetic choice sprouted a hidden thicket of financial strain. In his youth he had traded worldly wealth for spiritual riches, and the ledger of his life bore the weight of that sacrifice. As years turned to wisdom, his understanding outpaced that of his peers, and he sought to stabilize his finances&mdash;not merely for himself, but to lift a dear friend into retirement. The success of this venture sparked a tempest among those he called family and friends: jealousy, anger, and resentment swirled like a dark storm. When the treasure was stolen, the very same faces that once smiled now attacked him viciously, as if they had been waiting for his fall since the dawn of time. The betrayers&mdash;the faithless, the quitters, the greedy, the intolerant&mdash;were men he had once prayed would return to the fold of Christianity; their swords were sharp, their words sharper, and they struck him down with the cruelty of those who had never known mercy.

His plight mirrors the lament of King David, whose trusted companions turned traitor, repaying kindness with treachery,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and also recalls the anguish of the Apostle Paul, who, though an apostle of grace, was besieged by false brethren and endured relentless persecution. Thus the story stands as a stark warning: even the most diligent, the most faithful, can be surrounded by those who wear the mask of piety while harboring envy and malice. May this narrative stir the hearts of all who hear it, urging them to guard their spirit against the corrosive poison of betrayal, and to cling ever tighter to the steadfast love of the Lord who alone remains faithful to the perseverant.</p>

<blockquote>
I have traveled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas. <strong>And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not [Greek <i>from false brothers</i>].</strong> I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm (New Living Translation, 2015, 2Cor. 11:26-27).

## The Chronicle of the Dying Father

<p style="text-indent:2em;">As his father lay upon the deathbed, He bore witness to the abyss of total depravity: as those who falsely wore the mantle of light revealed themselves as liars, full of darkness, reveling in the man's suffering, perversely and fanatically proclaiming his father's illness a divine retribution for daring to question their twisted, blasphemous, and heretical doctrine&mdash;a dogma of devils that masqueraded as faith yet was in reality a grotesque perversion of truth.

The weight of humiliation and degradation pressed upon him, and the embers of anger ignited within his soul; every cowardly sneer and whispered condemnation from those who cloaked themselves in false piety stung like a thousand needles, deepening the wounds of his father's suffering. Yet, in that crucible of despair, a fierce resolve begain to take shape. He would no longer remain a silent witness to their hypocrisy; he would rise from the ashes of his pain, fueled to action by their treachery, the very air around him crackling with a newfound intensity as if the universe itself conspired to help him. He envisioned a reckoning&mdash;a fiery purge of their heretical teachings that pretended to be light. With each heartbeat, his determination solidified, transforming grief into a weapon to dismantle the twisted beliefs that had wrought so much pain. He would not rest until their false light was extinguished and the truth&mdash;his father's truth&mdash;shone brightly in its place.

As he knelt in fervent prayer, a divine miracle unfolded before his eyes: his father, once burdened by affliction, was restored to health by God himself. Now, lifting his voice to the heavens, he beseeched the Holy Father to vindicate his spirit to grant him unwavering strength to obliterate every heresy that distorts the truth. He was so consumed by righteous fury&mdash;so ignited that he confronted and crushed the falsehoods that threatened to lead God's people astray. He stood as a burning beacon of truth, championing the purity of God's word and striking down each deception that dared rise against the Almighty; his enemies learned the cost of defiance as plots unraveled and proud men were ground to dust. Victory had been ordained before the foundations of the earth. He rose, and consequence followed those who opposed the righteous.</p>

## The Cautionary Tale of Unrighteous Rebecca

<p style="text-indent:2em;">I would like to share with you another story, as many claim the name of Christ yet stray far from His teachings: there exists a cautionary tale shrouded in mystery, the tale of unrighteous Rebecca&mdash;a Rebecca in name only. She was a figure of self‑righteousness, so consumed by her own pride that she failed to recognize the grace extended to her by the very Savior she professed to follow. Among the most troubling of her transgressions was her refusal to forgive those whom Christ had already forgiven. In her heart, envy festered like a dark shadow, particularly towards a humble saint who had turned from his past sins. This saint, though impoverished, was gifted with remarkable talents that ignited a fire of jealousy within her. Unable to bear his light, she embarked on a relentless campaign to undermine him, sowing discord and destroying the bonds of friendship he had forged. Time passed, and the saint, ever hopeful, reached out to her in friendship, only to be met with her cold disdain, bitter scorn, and poisonous hatred. Years of verbal degradation and humiliation ensued, until one day, the saint mysteriously vanished, leaving behind only whispers of his existence. Yet, unbeknownst to unrighteous Rebecca, the heavens were watching. God, in His infinite wisdom, remembered her unforgiving heart. In a twist of fate, God granted the saint a ministry of his own, a testament to his redemption. God recalled how she had belittled his intellect, and in response, bestowed upon him great brilliance and renown. God remembered her mockery of his frailty when he was weak from sickness, and so He transformed him, restoring his health and strength in a manner that astonished everyone. Thus, the tale unfolds&mdash;Beware the fate that befell unrighteous Rebecca. Let her story echo through the ages as a haunting warning about the perils of envy and unforgiveness, lest one unwittingly treads a similar path to embarrassment and destruction.</p>

<!-- ## Conclusion -->

<!-- <p style="text-indent:2em;">Remember Christ's resonant question&mdash;when he challenged what truly binds a family, asking who, in the end, are his real brothers and sisters (Matt. 12:48-50; Mk. 3:33-35; Lk. 8:19-21):</p>

<blockquote>
Jesus asked, “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?” 49 Then he pointed to his disciples and said, “Look, these are my mother and brothers. <strong>Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister</strong> and mother!” (New Living Translation, 2015, Matt. 12:48-50).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Jesus replied, “My mother and <strong>my brothers are all those who hear God’s word and obey it</strong>” (New Living Translation, 2015, Luke 8:21).

Remeber that Christ Perseveres the Saints; True Believers Naturally Share This Effortless, Supernatural State.

<blockquote>
We know that God’s children do not make a practice of sinning, for God’s Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them (New Living Translation, 2015, 1 John 5:18).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
But the one who endures to the end will be saved (New Living Translation, 2015, Matthew 24:13).
</blockquote>

The Greek word for falling away in the new testament is .... Backsliding and Apostasy are not the same thing, but the rememdy for both are the same--repentance.

Calvinists view perseverance through the lens of divine monergism, which is divine preservation or protection; whereas Arminians view perseverance as a synergistic activity, by faithful human efforts enabled by prevenient grace. Only under Arminianism's conditional security can a person fall away for good. The Scriptures, however, make it clear that the one who does the preserving is Christ:

> We know that God’s children do not make a practice of sinning, for God’s Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them (New Living Translation, 2015, 1Jn. 5:18).

> 1 John 3:9 John affirmed that “no one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.” <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:orangered;">This confirms moderate Calvinism</span>’s</span> view of eternal security for two reasons. First, anyone truly born of God cannot persist in evil. **If someone does, then he is not born of God.** That is, a Christian’s perseverance in avoiding continual, habitual sin is a proof of his salvation &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 11.

> **Apparently there are many who claim to be believers that in fact are not. ... We do believe in the perseverance of the saints (true believers)**, but are deeply concerned about sinful lifestyles and rebellious hearts among those who call themselves "Christians." &mdash; Chuck Smith -->

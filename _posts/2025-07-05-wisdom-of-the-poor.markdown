## Listen to the Story of the Poor Wise Man

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
Without the modal nuance the story would say that he saved the city but that no one remembered him, whereas with the modal nuance it says, that he could have saved the city but they were destroyed for not listening. It seems like there is more consequence for ignoring wisdom with this approach, but either way, the wisdom of the poor is despised by the world. What do you think will happen if you keep disregarding the wisdom of the poor? (Prov. 29:1 NET). Personally, I enjoy the story with the modal nuance.</p>

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, and it is a great burden to me: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> There was once a small city with a few men in it, and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, and <span style="color:Goldenrod;">he could have delivered the city by his wisdom, but no one listened to that poor man</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, but <span style="color:Goldenrod;">a poor man’s wisdom is despised</span>; no one ever listens to his advice (NET Bible, 2019, Ecclesiastes 9:13-16 NET).

>> g. Ecclesiastes 9:15 **tn** Or “he delivered.” The verb וּמִלַּט (umillat, from מָלַט, malat, “to deliver”) is functioning either in an indicative sense (past definite action: “he delivered”) or in a modal sense (past potential: “he could have delivered”). The literal meaning of זָכַר (zakhar, “to remember”) in the following line harmonizes with the indicative: “but no one remembered that poor man [afterward].” However, the modal is supported by v. 16: “A poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.” This approach must nuance זָכַר (“to remember”) as “[no one] listened to [that poor man].” Most translations favor the indicative approach: “he delivered” or “he saved” (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, NIV); however, some adopt the modal nuance: “he might have saved” (NEB, NJPS, NASB margin) (NET Bible, 2019, NOTES).

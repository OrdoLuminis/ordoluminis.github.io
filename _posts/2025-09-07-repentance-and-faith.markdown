Repentance is a fruit of genuine saving faith,<sup>1</sup> and we know fruits come from the Holy Spirit, not by our own power.<sup>2</sup> Jesus was sent to turn people from their sins in repentance.<sup>3</sup> It is described as a God given<sup>4</sup> contrition that leads to salvation<sup>5</sup> and the forgiveness of sins.<sup>6</sup> False repentance, or attrition, lacks the inward resolve to turn from sin and leads to death:</p>

<blockquote>
2Cor. 7:9-10 Two kinds of sorrow are mentioned: (1) Worldly sorrow that lacks repentance leads to spiritual death (e.g., see Matt 27:3-6; Heb 12:16-17). (2) Sorrow that leads us away from sin leads to salvation, as it did when the church in Corinth responded positively to Paul’s rebuke (Filament Study, 2015, 2Cor. 7:10)
</blockquote>

1\. Mt 3:8-10.<br>
2\. Gal 5:22-23; Jn 15:4-5.<br>
3\. Ac. 3:19-20,26; 26:20; Re. 2:5.<br>
4\. Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25.<br>
5\. 2Cor. 7:10.<br>
6\. Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31.
</small>

The unrepentant<sup>7</sup> will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven;<sup>8</sup> not because they fail to do works&mdash;that would be legalism&mdash;but because they're unregenerate.<sup>9</sup> Only those with genuine faith receive this new nature.<sup>10</sup> The practitioners of evil&mdash;the irreligious, unrepentant, and self‑deceived&mdash;thus show great evidence that they are not truly born‑again.<sup>9,3</sup>

7\. Luk. 13:3.<br>
8\. Matt. 18:3; Gal. 5:19-21; 1Cor. 6:9-11; Eph. 5:5-6; Luk 9:62.<br>
9\. John 3:3; 1John 3:9.<br>
10\. 2Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.

Assurance of salvation comes from a living faith. The faith that justifies, Luther said, is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.<sup>11</sup> Justification is by faith alone,<sup>12</sup> but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified: "Its proper evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance, and faith, and newness of life" (Order of Light, 2024, <a href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/new-hampshire-confession-1833/#grace-in-regeneration">A7.41</a>).

11\. Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:3-6; Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; Heb. 5:9; 1Jn 5:3-4.<br>
12\. Ro. 3:28; Eph. 2:8-10.
</small>

So we conclude, that <strong>a lack of repentance is evidence of a superficial faith</strong>; for repentance is the fruit of genuine saving faith. The unrepentant will perish.<sup>13</sup> They were never alive in Christ. They honored God with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him.<sup>14</sup> Their faith is dead.<sup>15</sup>

<small>
13\. Luk. 13:3.<br>
14\. Matt. 15:8-9.<br>
15\. Jas. 2:14-26.
</small>

These are they that accumulate false teachers who entice them with new teachings<sup>16</sup> that cause them to fall into debauchery<sup>17</sup> and abuse the precious grace of our God by twisting it into a license to sin.<sup>18</sup> Everyone has sin,<sup>19</sup> but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin.<sup>20</sup> Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;practices&rdquo; sin, because the Son of God holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them.<sup>21</sup>

<small>
16\. 2Tim. 4:3-4.<br>
17\. 2Pet. 2:1-2.<br>
18\. Jud. 4.<br>
19\. 1Jn. 1:8–10.<br>
20\. 1Jn. 3:6-10.<br>
21\. 1Jn. 5:18.
</small>

A person who claims Christianity but denies repentance has likely apostatized, for it is impossible for them to return to repentance,<sup>22</sup> and yet nothing is impossible for God.<sup>23</sup> If they truly trust in Christ then we should assume that the Good Shepherd has returned them to the fold;<sup>24</sup> they will turn from unbelief or false-idols and repent in sincere contrition.<sup>5</sup>

<small>
22\. Heb. 6:4-6; 10:26-31.<br>
23\. Matt. 19:26; Mk. 10:27; Luk. 1:37.<br>
24\. Matt. 18:12-14; Luk. 15:4-7.

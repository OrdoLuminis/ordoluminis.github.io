<p style="text-indent:2em;">
Repentance is taught to be a fruit of genuine saving faith,¹ and we know fruits come from the Holy Spirit, not by our own doing.² Jesus was sent to turn people from their sins in repentance.³ It is described as a God given⁴ contrition that leads to salvation.⁵</p>

<small>
1\. Mt 3:8-10.<br>
2\. Gal 5:22-23; Jn 15:4-5.<br>
3\. Ac. 3:19-20,26; 26:20; Re. 2:5.<br>
4\. Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25.<br>
5\. 2Cor. 7:10.
</small>

The unrepentant⁶ will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven;⁷ not because they fail to do works&mdash;that would be legalism&mdash;but because they're unregenerate.⁸ Only those with genuine faith receive this new nature.⁹

<small>
6\. Luk. 13:3.<br>
7\. Matt. 18:3; Gal. 5:19-21; 1Cor. 6:9-11; Eph. 5:5-6; Luk 9:62.<br>
8\. John 3:3; 1John 3:9.<br>
9\. 2Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.
</small>

Assurance of salvation comes from a living faith. The faith that justifies, Luther said, is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.¹⁰

<small>
10\. 1Jn 2:3-6; Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; Heb. 5:9; 1Jn 5:3-4.
</small>

So we conclude, that <strong>a lack of repentance is evidence of a superficial faith</strong>; for repentance is the fruit of genuine saving faith. The unrepentant will perish.¹¹ They were never alive in Christ. They honored God with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him.¹² Their faith was superficial.¹³

<small>
11\. Luk. 13:3.<br>
12\. Matt. 15:8-9.<br>
13\. Jas. 2:14-26.
</small>

These are they that accumulate false teachers who entice them with new teachings¹⁴ that cause them to fall into debauchery¹⁵ and abuse the precious grace of our God by twisting it into a license to sin.¹⁶

<small>
14\. 2Tim. 4:3-4.<br>
15\. 2Pet. 2:1-2.<br>
16\. Jud. 4.
</small>

Justification is by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified: "Its proper evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance, and faith, and newness of life" (Order of Light, 2024, <a href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/new-hampshire-confession-1833/#grace-in-regeneration">A7.41</a>).

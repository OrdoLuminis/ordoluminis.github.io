<p style="text-indent:2em;">
Repentance is taught to be a fruit of genuine saving faith,<sup>1</sup> and we know fruits come from the Holy Spirit, not by our own doing.<sup>2</sup> Jesus was sent to turn people from their sins in repentance.<sup>3</sup> It is described as a God given<sup>4</sup> contrition that leads to salvation<sup>5</sup> and the forgiveness of sins.<sup>6</sup></p>

<small>
1\. Mt 3:8-10.<br>
2\. Gal 5:22-23; Jn 15:4-5.<br>
3\. Ac. 3:19-20,26; 26:20; Re. 2:5.<br>
4\. Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25.<br>
5\. 2Cor. 7:10.<br>
6\. Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31.
</small>

The unrepentant<sup>7</sup> will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven;<sup>8</sup> not because they fail to do works&mdash;that would be legalism&mdash;but because they're unregenerate.<sup>9</sup> Only those with genuine faith receive this new nature.<sup>10</sup>

<small>
7\. Luk. 13:3.<br>
8\. Matt. 18:3; Gal. 5:19-21; 1Cor. 6:9-11; Eph. 5:5-6; Luk 9:62.<br>
9\. John 3:3; 1John 3:9.<br>
10\. 2Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.
</small>

Assurance of salvation comes from a living faith. The faith that justifies, Luther said, is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.<sup>11</sup>

<small>
11\. 1Jn 2:3-6; Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; Heb. 5:9; 1Jn 5:3-4.
</small>

So we conclude, that <strong>a lack of repentance is evidence of a superficial faith</strong>; for repentance is the fruit of genuine saving faith. The unrepentant will perish.<sup>12</sup> They were never alive in Christ. They honored God with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him.<sup>13</sup> Their faith is dead.<sup>14</sup>

<small>
12\. Luk. 13:3.<br>
13\. Matt. 15:8-9.<br>
14\. Jas. 2:14-26.
</small>

These are they that accumulate false teachers who entice them with new teachings<sup>15</sup> that cause them to fall into debauchery<sup>16</sup> and abuse the precious grace of our God by twisting it into a license to sin.<sup>17</sup> Everyone has sin (1Jn. 1:8â€“10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn. 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that *&ldquo;practices&rdquo;* sin, because the Son of God holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them (1Jn. 5:18).

<small>
15\. 2Tim. 4:3-4.<br>
16\. 2Pet. 2:1-2.<br>
17\. Jud. 4.
</small>

Justification is by faith alone,<sup>18</sup> but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified: "Its proper evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance, and faith, and newness of life" (Order of Light, 2024, <a href="https://ordoluminis.com/posts/new-hampshire-confession-1833/#grace-in-regeneration">A7.41</a>). A person who claims Christianity but denies repentance has likely apostatized, for it is impossible for them to return to repentance,<sup>19</sup> and yet nothing is impossible for God.<sup>20</sup> If they truly trust in Christ then we should assume that the Good Shepherd has returned them to the fold;<sup>21</sup> they will turn from unbelief or false-idols and repent in sincere contrition.<sup>5</sup>

<small>
18\. Ro. 3:28; Eph. 2:8-10.<br>
19\. Heb. 6:4-6; 10:26-31.<br>
20\. Matt. 19:26; Mk. 10:27; Luk. 1:37.<br>
21\. Matt. 18:12-14; Luk. 15:4-7.

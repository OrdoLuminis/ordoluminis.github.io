# Of the Eternal Brotherhood, an Order of Light.

The Order of Light is a prestigious order of scientists and scholars allegiant to Christ, dedicated to the advancement of scientific knowledge and preservation of biblical truth. We stand as a **non-sectarian, inter-denominational and ecumenical** assembly of Historic Protestants, a noble coalition of diverse, theologically conservative Christians united in our quest to uphold divine truth. While we are **creedal and confessional**, we are also free from the constraints of rigid man-made systems, we embrace a logical and reasoned approach to faith based on scripture, forging a path that transcends traditional boundaries and elevates our collective purpose.
